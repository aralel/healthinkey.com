# Plan

## Goal
Create a GitHub-hosted landing page for **healthinkey.com** (personal medical record organization and sharing).

## Scope
- Static landing page (no backend)
- GitHub Pages compatible
- Clear product messaging, privacy-first positioning, and CTA placeholders

## Deliverables
- `index.html`
- `assets/styles.css`
- `assets/app.js`
- `README.md` with GitHub Pages setup
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with changes

## Current prompt (Jan 29, 2026)
Create a landing website for healthinkey.com that explains the purpose: organizing medical records, medication history, sharing with relatives, and enabling remote second opinions.

Additional request (Jan 29, 2026, icons)
- Use favicon and app icons from `assets/icons`.
- Fix `browserconfig.xml` and `manifest.json` so their icon paths point to `assets/icons` (GitHub Pages friendly relative paths).

Additional request (Jan 29, 2026, responsiveness & logo)
- Make the landing page more responsive, especially on smaller screens.
- Use the logo image from `assets/healthinkey_logo_v1.png` in the layout.

Additional request (Jan 29, 2026, header & footer)
- Redo the header and footer design using the existing logo and sections.
  - Footer refinement: remove `brand-logo-small`, keep tagline directly under the logo.
